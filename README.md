Hello!

Did you have any Covid project over the quarentine?
For me, one of the project was work out. I really got into lifting and working out.
But often times when I went to the gym, I was very lost. What should I do today? How long will I work out today.

Then I remembered a project I made long time ago. It was a simple Fitness Application with Java.
Inspired and also using few structures and methods from it, I came up with better and more personalised Fitness App! 
Now, It calculates my aim progress over time and also comes up with excersize list, with intensity and duration, I should do for the day!

Im still figuring stuff out and also adding more feature and exersizes in! Please let me know if you have a suggestion!
If not, Please enjoy:))
